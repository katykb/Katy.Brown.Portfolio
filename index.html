     <p class="about-summary">
            After earning a degree in Fashion Merchanding, I gained valuable experience
            working for retail organizations in both
            the store enviornment and corporate office.
            <br>
            <br>
            Putting my retail experience to work, I began working for myself. I opend an online
            vintage clothing business that eventually led to a stand alone
            vintage shop.
            <br>
            <br>
            Web Development is the exciting next step in my career!  I look forward to challenging and exciting projects that will
            put my retail, customer service and management skills to the test.
